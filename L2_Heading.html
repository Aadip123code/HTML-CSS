<large>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that <sub>orbit it.</sub><br> It formed about <i><b>4.6
billion years ago</b></i> when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc.<br> The Sun
is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing
this energy from its outer photosphere.<br> Astronomers classify it as a <sup>G-type</sup> main-sequence star.</large>
